#### On Ornithology follows a birdwatcher as he makes the most important discovery of his career. A discovery that will forever change the way he watches birds.

### Produced in under 32 hours for Kino Kabaret Sydney (#77)
### Directed and shot by Emmett Redding and [Max Piantoni](http://maxpiantoni.com).

#### Max and I worked together on devising the concept and creating the costumes and props before shooting in the same day, and I edited the next day.
