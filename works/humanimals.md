### **SYNOPSIS**

In a world where the roles of humans and animals have been flipped, **HUMANIMALS** explores the complex relationship between humans and animals through a series of revenge-comedy vignettes.  
But to what end?

### **About HUMANIMALS, from the Director**

HUMANIMALS began after considering why I felt increasingly desensitised towards discussions of animal rights activism.  
The film explores multiple facets of the issues surrounding animal ethics and consumption by substituting animals with humans in a comedic, but ultimately violent, light.

I was interested in asking audiences to think about how they interact with animals in their daily lives—both directly and indirectly—and how they actually feel about this relationship.
