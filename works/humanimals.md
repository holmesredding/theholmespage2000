### I composited and assisted in the ideation of {{< highlightLink href="https://benjaminmansur.weebly.com/humanimals.html" text="HUMANIMALS" >}} with Director Benjamin Mansur. 

### SYNOPSIS

In a world where the roles of humans and animals have been flipped, HUMANIMALS explores the complex relationship between humans and animals through a series of revenge-comedy vignettes. But to what end?

### About HUMANIMALS, from the Director

HUMANIMALS began after considering why I felt increasingly desensitised towards discussions of animal rights activism.
The film explores multiple facets of the issues surrounding animal ethics and consumption by substituting animals with humans in a comedic, but ultimately violent, light.
I was interested in asking audiences to think about how they interact with animals in their daily lives, both directly and indirectly, and how they actually feel about this relationship.
