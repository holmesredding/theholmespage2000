#### *Running Late* is a stop-motion animation which follows two monsters who are running late to see a movie.

### Produced in under 12 hours for monthly short film festival <a href="https://filmonik.com.au" target="_blank">Filmonik</a>, I made *Running Late* to see how fast I could go from idea to creation to shooting. Using a minimal set and props I created the film the day it was presented.
