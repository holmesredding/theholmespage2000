# **Drumroll Please (New Website!)**

*July 28, 2023*

#### **Here it is! I finally got around to making a website for myself! I've been meaning to learn css and all sorts of other things forever, after just ignoring learning any web dev and relying on Squarespace for a million years. Don't get me wrong, Squarespace is really handy, but at the speed I update the site it just made more sense to me to make something static and small that I can tinker with when I feel like it. Also, I wanted to learn stuff.**

#### When I was doing my MA in Animation, Games and Interactivity I dabbled<sup id="ref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> in coding - I made a few little interactive scribbles that were fun but at the time felt like hell to make.

#### **I had no idea what I was doing or where I was wanting to go with this, so I fell back on my old trusty animation and film education for the latter half of the course. This was still great, I made a micro film that won some awards, and my research on Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman and his filmmaking style *MYSTIMATION* was published in academic journals.**

#### **But yeah, coding? That was hard. I hadn't actually really coded much at all before - unless you count [ActionScript 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) when I was making things in *Macromedia Flash MX 2004*.**

#### **I felt too much pressure to be able to learn how to code at the same time as trying to create at a Masters level. Now that I'm not under that deadline crunch though, I have been able to get back into things and learn at the pace I need to.**

#### **The idea for [ScreenDiary](http://www.screendiary.app) has been bopping about in my head for a really long time, and I finally got around to learning some [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) to achieve it.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Then as part of the process of making ScreenDiary I naturally had to make a website for it - and I really just did not want to pay SquareSpace fees again. The time had come. I had to learn *something* web related. So I looked into various Static Site Generators, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) fit my needs. I already knew how to write in Markdown so that made it easier. I played around with different Hugo themes<sup id="ref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> but again, *I wanted to learn stuff* - so I learned what CSS I needed to, made that site, and then figured hey, now I know it, why don't I do my personal site?**

<p id="fn1"><b>1.</b> and to even call it dabbling is a <em>major</em> stretch <a href="#ref1">↩</a></p>
<p id="fn2"><b>2.</b> I had heard that SwiftUI was a fairly simple starting point with learning to code - I figured it must be since you can use an iPad to make Swift things. It probably <em>is</em> an easy starting point but knowing what I know now I'd probably have made ScreenDiary with UIKit instead. <a href="#ref2">↩</a></p>
